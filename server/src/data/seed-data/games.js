      'Four million battles every day. One Shadowverse. Japan\'s #1 strategic card game. Made by card gamers for card gamers. "One of my favorite games this year" - IGN Shadowverse is Japan\'s #1 strategic card game! - There are millions of Shadowverse battles every day, and a multitude of ways to play - Easy to get into, thanks to a singleplayer story mode, free card packs for new players, and bonuses every day - Battles are finely balanced, with less RNG than other card games, and balance adjustments take place every month - New card expansions are released every three months, unleashing new deck-building strategies and battle tactics - We’ve got a great community of 22 million players and counting, with tournaments and esports broadcasts every week and support for streamers - Featuring beautiful art and animations and fully voiced cards and story - A multitude of ways to play: With eight different leader classes, Shadowverse gives you unparalleled freedom to create your own deck strategies. Will you play as Urias and unleash your Vengeance when your health is depleted? Or will you select Isabelle, whose spells power up the cards in your hand? Will you go all in with an aggro deck, or try to contain the board with a control deck? Or will you try to sneak in some sublimely ingenious combos? It’s entirely up to you. - Easy to get into: Learn the basics by playing through our extensive singleplayer story mode before taking on other players in our multiplayer modes. Be sure to pick up your free card packs after you’ve finished playing through the tutorial – just go to your Crate from the main menu to pick them up. And bonuses and daily missions help you unlock new card packs every day so it won’t be long before you have a deck that is capable of competing with the very best. - Finely balanced: There’s less RNG in Shadowverse than other card games, making it supremely balanced: you’ll need to trust your judgement not your luck if you are to come out on top. And we make balance adjustments every month to make sure that no one card or deck type becomes too dominant. - New card expansions released regularly: New card expansions are added every three months to make sure the meta never gets stale. And every single expansion unleashes new deck-building strategies and battle tactics, and even new leader classes and game modes. We’re in this for the long haul and we hope you will be too. - Beautiful art: All of the cards in Shadowverse feature fantastic art by some of Japan’s finest artists, and every single card is available as an animated version. Every card is also fully-voiced, in English and Japanese, as is the singleplayer storyline. - A great community: And last but not least, we have some amazing fans. We’ve got memes, we’ve got streams, and we have much, much more to offer than the average card game. Community tournaments and e-sports broadcasts take place every week, and there are a ton of deck-building resources online in case you get stuck. Millions of card gamers can’t be wrong – why don’t you join them?',

      'a fully simulated ecosystem bustling with thousands of growing plants and animals living their lives. Build, harvest, and take resources from an environment where your every action affects the world around you. An imminent meteor strike threatens global destruction. Can you save the world without destroying it in the process? Construct buildings and towns, tend to your farm, hunt wildlife, build infrastructure and transportation, craft clothing, build power plants, and research new technologies. Specialize in a craft and trade your goods to other players. Develop your civilization and sculpt your planet. As your civilization grows, you’ll need to analyze data from the simulation; evaluating the impact you have on your world. Use this data as evidence in proposed laws, restricting harmful activities without disrupting the advancement of technology. Balance your individual needs with the needs of community, all while maintaining the state of the ecosystem. The future of your world is in your hands. Every organism in Eco exists as part of a detailed simulation; a disruption in one species can have cascading effects across the planet. Chop down all the trees, and habitats for creatures will be destroyed. Pollute the rivers with mining waste, and your farms will become poisoned and die. The ecosystem supplies the resources you and your community will need to stop the meteor. Manage your pollution, mining waste, hunting, and resource collection to balance your effect on this system. Eco is built on a rich ecological simulation. All the data generated from the interaction of plants, animals, climate, and players can be searched and analyzed using in-game graphs and heat-maps. Use the collected information as scientific evidence support to proposed laws. The ability to successfully debate using scientific evidence is your greatest weapon against the destruction of your world. Establish and maintain your own set of laws and government, which are enforced automatically by the game. Draft a proposal to limit clear-cutting in a protected forest, incentivize green energy solutions over fossil fuels by providing tax subsidies and penalties. Participate in elections for world leadership, allowing you to set tax rates and allocate community money. Use a programmable law system to make dynamic and flexible rules for the community, passing them by vote. Construct a wide variety of governments; from tightly-regulated dictator-states, to tax-and-spend subsidy programs, or even lawless communities relying on trust. Your skills increase based on your food and shelter. By consuming a highly nutritious variety of food and building an elaborate home you will rapidly increase your skill points. Skill points can be spent on skills like farming, hunting, trade, engineering, research, and more. Contribute to the greater good while increasing your own personal success. In the player-run economy, you achieve the most when you specialize and trade both goods and services. Create stores to buy and sell goods you need asynchronously with other players. Setup contracts within the game’s quest-like labor market, soliciting other players to perform specialized work for you in exchange for payment. Build complex crafting machines and charge a fee for players to use them. A thriving economy in Eco can be both a powerful tool for progress, or a dangerous threat to the environment. To grease the wheels of commerce, you can create your own currencies, backed by fiat or by resources. Manage the value of your currency relative to others by setting exchange rates at asynchronous currency exchanges. Sell items at stores and collect credit from other players. Eco is designed for rich asynchronous play, allowing many players of many disciplines to contribute to one another’s goals at separate or simultaneous times. All of the world’s resources originate from its environment, which is affected by your actions. While a meteor looms over head — set to strike the planet in thirty days — a more subtle threat grows from player-interaction with the environment. Without careful attention, ecological destruction can destroy civilization before the meteor even strikes. To ultimately succeed, you and your community will need to use the tools of government and economy to find a balance between progress and protection.',

Now surviving as a reclusive mercenary on the edge of a corrupted world, the formidable warrior must again wield a devastating combination of guns, blades, magic and wit to strike down the demonic legions overwhelming the world. Battle alongside allies online in four-player co-op or go it alone in spectacular procedurally-generated landscapes to complete daring missions and collect powerful new weapons, armor, and arcane relics of legend.\nFive years have passed since Lo Wang shattered the alliance between his deceitful former boss and the ancient gods of the shadow realm. Despite noble intentions, Lo Wang’s efforts to annihilate the darkness corrupted the world, creating a strange and savage new order where humans and demons live side by side. The once feared warrior now lives in the shifting wildlands outside the reach of his enemies and the neon glow of Zilla’s cybernetic metropolis, scratching out a meager existence as a hired sword for the local Yakuza clans. When a simple mission goes wrong, Lo Wang is drawn into a volatile conflict between a brilliant young scientist, his nemesis Orochi Zilla, and the demonic forces that have become unsettled in our world. The sharp-tongued hero must once again wield lethal blades, staggering firepower, and archaic magic to purge the world of evil. Lo Wang delivers his own brand full throttle brutality with an expanded array of over 70 lethal blades and explosive firearms to overcome the demonic opposition. Become a whirlwind of steel and blood with razor sharp katana, short swords, crescent blades, and hand claws or unleash a hellish symphony of ornate firearms to decimate your enemies. Battle through the expansive campaign alone or team up as a four-player typhoon of destruction online in campaign co-op mode. Tackle challenging primary missions or thrilling side quests while maintaining your own ninja style with customizable armor, items, and valuable loot from your triumphs. The breach between the human and demon realms created an interdimensional hernia resulting in constant shifts to the world of Shadow Warrior 2. Procedurally generated landscapes and paths bring new twists and turns to once familiar terrain and routine missions. Choose your weapon based on the situation at hand and then dismantle everything that stands in your path with an advanced gore system. Use precision blade strikes to separate limbs and heads or switch to heavy ordinance and blow a hole right through colossal beasts. Upgrade weapons in your arsenal with up to three stones at once to improve performance or augment them with devastating elemental effects. Collect karma, amulets, and armor to enhance Lo Wang’s power and shift his death-dealing artistry into overdrive. The Shadow Warrior series started back in the 90s with Shadow Warrior Classic that was remastered and released on Steam by Devolver Digital and 3D Realms as Shadow Warrior Classic Redux. Then in 2013, Flying Wild Hog and Devolver Digital released the bold reimagining of the legend of Lo Wang with the modern classic Shadow Warrior.',

Be it powerful armoured combat vehicles, unstoppable resource gathering machines, sprawling resource processing bases or a hybrid of all three - creativity is your key to exo-planetary success. The worlds in TerraTech are procedurally generated and infinite, so there are always new lands to discover and more resources to find. Treacherous mountain ranges, luscious grasslands and huge deserts are among the biomes you will encounter. More will be added as development progresses. The intergalactic mining industry is a profitable one, but you are not the only miner in search for new worlds to exploit. Defending yourself from rival miners will take time, resources and skill, with success leading to new territory and new lands. All equipable blocks and items can be damaged or destroyed, so ensuring you are sufficiently armed and ready for battle is a key element of both survival and prosperity in TerraTech. Get out there and show them who’s boss! By gathering and processing natural resources, players are able to construct storage, refining and construction bases in order to craft new blocks in the game. Like the look of that Venture Hail Fire Rifle that just tore your vehicle apart? Go prospecting for the needed resources, and craft a couple for yourself in the shiny new Venture fabricator which you just aquired, by beating their time trial challenge in the nearby mountains. All exo-planetary prospectors buy parts from the established Mining Corporations, where each have their own specific brand of mining technology. Get the job done with GSO, strip-mine to the max with the heavy-duty GeoCorp, zoom around with high-performance recon specialists Venture, function with military efficiency utilising the stealth focused Hawkeye or gain technological superiority with Enviro-giants Better Future. New Corporations we’re aiming to add to the game include deranged experimental scientists Reticule Research, and the hive-mind AI swarms of LEGION.

      'From a team including former designers of HITMAN and PAYDAY comes Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden, a tactical game that combines the turn-based combat of XCOM with real-time stealth and exploration of a post-human world reclaimed by nature… and Mutants. Of course the world ends. It was just a question of time. Extreme climate change, global economic crisis, a lethal pandemic, and increasing tension between old and new superpowers. For the first time since 1945 nuclear weapons were used in armed conflict. Mushroom clouds rose from east to west before the dust settled. Now it’s over and the Earth is still. Nature has invaded ruined cities. Wind sweeps through empty streets, turned into graveyards. The humans are all gone. Scavenging through the remains of civilization are the Mutants, deformed humanoids and animals alike, searching for salvation or just something to eat. To survive, you and your companions must venture out to explore the Zone. Maybe one day you will find the Eden of legends, the ancients’ haven in the middle of hell. That’s where truth awaits, the stories say. Maybe you will find your answers there. Then again, maybe it’s all bullshit. Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden is the ultimate fix for your tactical strategy addiction. Dive into a deep, turn-based, tactical combat system inspired by the XCOM games. Journey through a post-human world of abandoned cities, crumbling highways, and overgrown countryside. Check back at the Ark, a neon-bathed oasis of ill repute and questionable characters, to restock your supplies and plan out your next adventure. A duck with an attitude problem and a boar with anger issues; these aren’t your typical heroes. Get to know Dux, Bormin, Selma, and many other characters each with their own unique personality and deranged perspective on the world and their situation. Sneak through shadows to avoid conflict or to catch enemies unaware. Real-time stealth allows you full control of approach: sneak into an enemy camp, position the team of Mutants to your advantage, and gain the element of surprise. Unlock new mutations and abilities for your Mutants, such as Selma’s grasping vines, Bormin’s Charge, and Dux‘ uncanny ability to sneak into a camp full of enemies unnoticed, despite being a 4-foot tall walking, talking duck with a crossbow. Use the environment to your advantage. Stay out of floodlights, hide from line of sight, or just blast down fully destructible walls and buildings and wreak utter havoc. From makeshift slingshots to high-powered rifles and top hats to police vests, make sure you equip your Mutants for the dangers ahead. Nothing says post-human quite like a mutated boar in spiked metal armor charging at you with a blunderbuss in his hands.',

      "is a unique combination of survival, management, Rogue-Like events, turn-based combat, classic role-playing game with tons of quests and a story in which your decisions directly affect plot progression! 10 years after the initial outbreak of the zombie apocalypse, the members of Jack's camp fled to Freedom City, where a cure for the zombie plague was developed. But the news brings more suffering than relief. New factions have sprung up in the region, in constant battle for dominance. The merciless Military, the shady Smugglers and the Independents made up primarily of civilians. When an Independents' refugee camp was overrun by an undead horde, the few survivors struggle for food and valuable resources in an unforgiving world, always looking over their shoulder for gangs of looters and the flesh-eating dead. While the big advantage of Dead Age's turn-based combat system versus tactics-based games is faster progression, the mechanics have evolved. A character can now bring up to 24 skills to the battle. Change up your tactics mid-fight to instantly gain the advantage over zombies and hostile survivors. Place front-row combatants to protect ranged-combat allies from attackers, and deploy turrets, hunting dogs and tigers, as well as an array of new weapons. Visit the outposts of other factions to trade and take on missions and improve your standing with them. Improving relations with the region's greater factions unlocks better equipment and plot devices. A negative reputation can lead to confrontation or even a bounty. Your 3D base is your central hub of operations. Here, you assign crafting or building jobs to survivors, build and upgrade stations to improve defense and quality of life and unlock improved craftable items and higher yield of resources. The new open game-world offers free exploration of the world map with over 80 detailed graphically depicted locations. Beside nature scenes, features new indoor locations like hospitals, bunkers, schools, malls and army supply stores. Decisions you make while playing can have significant effects on the progression of the story involving the three survivor factions, romanceable characters, and bring you closer to one of the game's six endings! Like its predecessor, features random events on the map resulting in a variety of consequences, but this time those events are depicted fully in 3D. Survival RPGs are especially dangerous. 3 difficulty levels and permadeath may result at any time in losing an ally for good. If your main character falls victim to the apocalypse you are forced to begin a new playthrough, for which you can purchase upgrades and advantages unlocked in previous runs. Gain enough standing with the factions and you may purchase things like upgraded faction equipment for newly-created characters, as well as unlock unique endings. This gives high replayability!",

      'Developed in the 1950s, the English Electric Type 1 was the first major step on British Railways’ path to dieselisation. After many trials and failures, the Type 1 showed promise as a 1000hp (746 kW) locomotive, and between 1957 and 1968 a total of 228 would be produced. The Type 1s took over from steam locomotives of equivalent power, primarily working light, mixed-freight traffic throughout the midlands and in Scotland. Unlike newer locomotives, the Type 1s featured a rather unique single cab design. The cab, situated at the rear of the locomotive, has controls facing in either direction and gives the locos a tank engine-like appearance, with the diesel engine and on-board equipment sat much like how a firebox and boiler would, in front of the cab. Another steam-like feature was the headcode discs adorning each end of the loco. The first 127 Type 1s were built as such. Visibility when travelling nose first was quickly realised as a concern, so it became common to see pairs of Type 1s coupled at the nose, allowing for greater view of the track ahead and with the added benefit of doubling the horsepower, meaning they could handle heaver trains. With the introduction of the TOPS classification system, the EE Type 1s were rebranded as BR Class 20s, although they are known by many as “Choppers” owing to their engines sounding like helicopters when under load. Despite being some of the oldest diesels around the Class 20s have remained in operational use to this day, and a rather fitting 20 examples have survived into preservation, making them a frequent sight on heritage railways. A veteran in every right, the Class 20 has earned its place among enthusiasts’ hearts; and now Type 1 traction comes to life in Train Sim World, ready for hard-working duty on the Tees Valley Line!',

To forge the destiny of this artificial being who is ignorant of both Good and Evil, you will have to explore the vast world and experience joy and sorrow.\nDr. Frankenstein's founding myth is once again revealed in all its glory through the innocent eyes of his creature. A thousand miles from the horror stories, here is a sensitive wander in the shoes of a pop icon.

Through evolving landscapes, the boundary between reality and fiction fades and the novel comes to life. Powerful and original, the soundtrack highlights the Creature's feelings of wanderlust. One choice after another, feel your way towards your destiny. Confronted with humans, you will no longer be able to escape the question of your origins. Who gave you life? This introspective quest will take you on an adventure across Europe. Bitter or pleasant, your experiences will bring you closer to the truth. Will you be ready to face it?

      'Blind is a narrative-driven psychological thriller for virtual reality where the player is blind and must explore their surroundings using echolocation. Waking up in a strange room with little memory of how she came to be there, a young woman makes the shocking discovery she has lost her sense of sight. Goaded by the sinister and twisted Warden, she must explore a perverse and frightening mansion using sound alone. By sending out soundwaves with a cane, the outlines of objects are briefly revealed, enabling the player to navigate the mansion, solve puzzles and uncover the mystery of what is happening to her. As she gets closer and closer to the truth, however, she will be forced to confront her worst enemy--that which she does not, or will not see. Born out of the Global Game Jam in 2014, which had the theme of “We don’t see things as they are, we see them as we are”, the Blind team won the Best Game award at the Turin (Italy) jam site with their entry Come to See My House. The team then began work on a full game based on this initial concept. Built from the ground up for virtual reality, Blind will be launching September 18, 2018. Learn to navigate carefully and cautiously using your cane. Send out soundwaves to reveal your surroundings briefly before they fade into darkness. Gramophones and other objects that make sound become lighthouses in the all-encompassing blackness. Built from the ground up for virtual reality and supporting binaural audio and motion control, Blind is a fully immersive and unique experience that removes you from the world you are used to, and asks you to see things differently. Where are you? Who is the Warden? Why has he kidnapped you and why does he want you to solve the puzzles in this strange and yet somehow eerily familiar place? Experience a constant sense of foreboding and emotional tension as you travel deeper into a mansion riddled with puzzles and dangers. As you search for answers, will you find things you’d rather not see?',

The horrifying remains of humanity, ravaged by the terrifying disease, are shuffling through the streets, waiting at every turn to prey on your living flesh. The nail-biting survival experience of ZombiU™ has been upgraded for download on next-gen consoles and PC. ZOMBI takes the power of the latest generation of hardware to bring you a new level of horror. Test your will to survive, but beware: death is permanent, and one wrong move can cause you to lose everything. Resources are scarce, your enemies are numerous, and you never know when you’ll find more weapons, ammunition, first aid, or food. How you allocate your resources determines if you live or die. Survival is not guaranteed. Once you die, your character becomes infected and joins the horde of undead shambling through London. You’ll come back as an entirely new character and try to survive, again, with your first mission being to retrieve your previous character’s supplies. Your bug-out bag holds all your possessions, tools, inventory, first aid kits, maps, and more. Don’t get distracted, as zombies can attack you at any moment. If you die, your bag stays with your old character, who is now a zombie. Will you risk it all to get your bag back, or start scavenging anew? Survive in a city steeped in grisly history, royal secrets, and bloody tales. Navigate through the medieval Tower of London, stately Buckingham Palace, and modern streets swarming with mobs of the undead. Combining the horror of ZombiU with refined gameplay and upgraded graphics, ZOMBI brings the survivalist first-person shooter to next-gen consoles and PC.

      'Call of Duty: Warzone is a free-to-play battle royale video game. The game is a part of the 2019 title Call of Duty: Modern Warfare but does not require purchase of it. Warzone allows online multiplayer combat among 150 players, although some limited-time game modes support 200 players. Codenamed Operation: Rapid Sunder, it is set in the fictional city of Verdansk, which is loosely based on Donetsk city in Eastern Ukraine,[2] on day 96 of the ongoing in-game conflict. The game features both cross-platform play and cross-platform progression between both games.\n The game features two main modes: Plunder and Battle Royale. Warzone introduces a new in-game currency system called "Cash" which is used at "Buy Stations" in and around Verdansk. "Loadout" drops are an example of where Cash can be traded for limited access to players\' custom classes (which are shared with Modern Warfare\'s standard modes). Players may also use Cash to purchase items such as "killstreaks" and gas masks. At launch, Warzone only offered Trios, a squad capacity of three players. However, in free post launch content updates, Solos, Duos and Quads have all been added to the game.',
