    title: 'Best RAM 2020: the top memory for your PC',
    content:
      'Looking for the best RAM may not be as sexy as looking into the latest and greatest CPUs and GPUs. However, it’s just as vital to your computer as the best processor and the best graphics card. Memory, which is both reliable and speedy, contributes a lot to your PC’s performance, so it’s important to pay just as much attention to the size, speed, capacity and overall quality of your RAM. Fast and reliable RAM will give you a much smoother computing experience overall, even if all you do is open 20 or so tabs at once when browsing the Internet in your spare time. Whether you’re building your next PC or upgrading your current one, choosing one of the best RAM for your PC will considerably improve its gaming and video editing performance. It will also help minimize sluggishness when tackling the most demanding tasks.',

    title: "Crysis Remastered system requirements won't melt your PC",
    content: `Crysis Remastered releases September 19 following a two-month delay after a famously underwhelming trailer. Ahead of the release, the official system requirements have been published on the Epic Games Store, and if you were worried that the famously hardware hungry shooter would challenge your current rig, you can probably breathe a sigh of relief. Still, it's unclear how the 'recommended' specs below apply if you're hoping to take complete advantage of the game's software ray tracing and still see decent performance. It's possible to get ray tracing running on non-RTX cards via proprietary game engine software or DirectX12's API , but for Crysis Remastered to work optimally on these relatively low specs it will rely entirely on CryEngine trickery, which has an "API-agnostic ray tracing solution".`,

    title: 'Nvidia announces $499 RTX 3070 that outpaces the $1,200 RTX 2080 Ti',
    content: `Nvidia has announced the RTX 3070, a $499 graphics card that is faster than a 2080 Ti for far less cash. With 20 shader TFLOPS, 40 RT TFLOPS, and 163 Tensor TFLOPS, the RTX 3070 is specced for high-end gaming. That's courtesy of the Ampere graphics architecture, and a whopping 5,888 CUDA cores. It's also equipped with 8GB of GDDR6 memory.`,

    title: "Nvidia's Ampere GPUs are bringing one of the best Xbox Series X and PS5 features to PC",
    content: `Nvidia has announced RTX IO, a feature of its new graphics cards that promises to handle data from high-speed SSDs with the graphics card, taking the load off your CPU. RTX IO is high-throughput decompression accelerated on the Ampere RTX 30-series GPUs, and Nvidia says it offers 100 times the throughput and 20x lower CPU utilisation compared to traditional CPU decompression. This technique looks awfully similar to the technology introduced with the Xbox Series X and found within the PlayStation 5, too.`,
